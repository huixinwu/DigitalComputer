                    <p>This OER material is intended for use as the first level of Digital Computer Theory for a two and
                        four year engineering technology program. The lecture and laboratory manual contains 13 weekly
                        lecture and lab experiments. The topics range from basic technical skills through numerical
                        system, logic gates, combination of logic circuits, simplification of logic circuit using
                        Boolean algebra, DeMorgan’s theory, and Karnaug Map, data control circuits such as multiplexer,
                        binary adder, and BCD decoder, counter design, clock circuits using 555 timer.</p>
                    <p>Lab experiments include brief introduction of the experimental topics, step by step procedures,
                        tables and graphs to record measurements, and questions to reinforce the understanding of the
                        theory with the experimental results. Each lab experiment is designed to be completed using a
                        two to three hour practicum period. For equipment, each lab station should include a dual
                        adjustable DC power supply and a quality DMM capable of reading DC voltage, current and
                        resistance.</p>
                    <p><em><b>A Note from the Authors</b></em></p>
                    <p> This OER project is based on reating a lecture and laboratory material for the course of
                        Introduction to Digital Computer Theory. In QCC, the Introduction to Digital Computer Theory
                        course is a major required course for students on most of the engineering technology majors.
                        Therefore, this OER material covers the appropriate topics to a sufficient depth of learning of
                        digital circuits while remains readable and accessible manner for the students.</p>

                <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
                <p>The impact of the digital computer on society has been tremendous; in its various forms, it is used
                    to run everything from spacecraft to factories, health-care systems to telecommunications, banks to
                    household budgets.</p>
                <p>The story of how the digital computer evolved is largely the story of an unending search for
                    labor-saving devices. Its roots go back beyond the calculating machines of the 1600s to the pebbles
                    (in Latin, calculi ) that the merchants of Rome used for counting and to the abacus of the fifth
                    century b.c. Although none of these early devices were automatic, they were useful in a world where
                    mathematical calculations performed by human beings were full of human error.</p>
                <p> Digital computer operates on discrete quantities (compare analog computer). All computation is done
                    within a finite number system and with limited precision, associated with the number of digits in
                    the
                    discrete numbers. The numerical information is most often represented by the use of two-state
                    electrical phenomena (on/off, high voltage/low voltage, current/no current, etc.) to indicate
                    whether the value of
                    a binary variable is a “zero” or a “one”. Usually there is automatic control or sequencing (through
                    a program) of operations so that they can be carried through to completion without intervention.</p>

                <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
                <p>Numerical system is a representative way to display digits, symbols, or letters. There are different ways to represent them, for example, binary number is the fundamental system use in computers and digital electronics because computers store information as 0 and 1, or “bits”, which is a short word for  binary digit. On the other hand, outside the computer world, the universal number of system used to represent quantities is the decimal system. Decimal system is the number system used in every day to represent quantities from the beginning of many ancient cultures where they calculated with numerals  based on ten, as the human hands have 10 digits.</p>
          
                <p> In this chapter, students will learn the different number of system use between the world of
                    computers and humans, and how to make the conversion between systems in order for the two different
                    world to understand and communicate. The number of system that will be covered are decimal, binary,
                    hexadecimal, and octal system. At the end of this chapter, BCD, and ASCII number of system.</p>

                <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
                <p>A logic gate is a building block of a digital circuit. Most logic gates have two inputs and one
                    output and are based on Boolean algebra. At any given moment, every terminal is in one of the two
                    binary conditions false (high) or true (low). False represents 0, and true represents 1. Depending
                    on the type of logic gate being used and the combination of inputs, the binary output will differ. A
                    logic gate can be thought of like a light switch, wherein one position the output is OFF as logic 0,
                    and in another, it is ON as logic 1.</p>

                <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
                <p>In digital circuit theory, combinational logic (sometimes also referred to as time-independent logic
                    ) is a type of digital logic which is implemented by Boolean circuits, where the output is a pure
                    function of the present input only.
                    Combinational logic is used in computer circuits to perform Boolean algebra on input signals and on
                    stored data. Practical computer circuits normally contain a mixture of combinational and sequential
                    logic. For example, the part of an arithmetic logic unit, or ALU, that does mathematical
                    calculations is constructed using combinational logic. Other circuits used in computers, such as
                    half adders, full adders, half subtractors, full subtractors, multiplexers, demultiplexers, encoders
                    and decoders are also made by using combinational logic. (Wikipedia, 2019).

                <p>Boolean algebra is the mathematics of digital systems. It is used to help analyze a logic circuit and
                    express its operation mathematically. Therefore, Boolean algebra can be used to simplify or to find
                    an equivalent logic circuit. The main operations of Boolean algebra are the conjunction and denoted
                    as ∧, Boolean addition, the disjunction or denoted as ∨, Boolean multiplication, and the negation
                    not denoted as ¬.

                <p>The result is that combinational logic circuits have no feedback, and any changes to the signals
                    being applied to their inputs will immediately have an effect at the output. In other words, in a
                    Combinational Logic Circuit, the output is dependent at all times on the combination of its inputs.
                    Thus a combinational circuit is memoryless.

                <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
                <p>The logic circuits that we have studied so far are consisted mainly of logic gates (AND, OR, NAND,
                    NOR, INVERT) combinational logic. Those circuits are also consider a memoryless circuit. They act as
                    an one time bit flow circuit that do not the capability to save the previous bit information. In
                    this chapter, we will deal with data storage circuitry that will latch on to (remember) a digital
                    state (1 or 0).

                <p>A Counter is a device, which stores (and sometimes displays) the number of times a particular event
                    has occurred, often in relationship to a CLOCK Signal. In electronics, counters can be implemented
                    quite easily using memory devices such as Flip-flops.

                <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
                <p>A logic gate is a building block of a digital circuit. Most logic gates have two inputs and one
                    output and are based on Boolean algebra. At any given moment, every terminal is in one of the two
                    binary conditions false (high) or true (low). False represents 0, and true represents 1. Depending
                    on the type of logic gate being used and the combination of inputs, the binary output will differ. A
                    logic gate can be thought of like a light switch, wherein one position the output is OFF as logic 0,
                    and in another, it is ON as logic 1.

                <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
                <p> Laboratories reap a wide array of safety hazards, which is why it is so vital to understand the
                    important of lab safety. If something goes awry, more than just your research project schedule can
                    be affected. Equipment can be damaged, fines can occur, and individuals on your team can be injured.
                </p>
                <p>When working in a lab, it is important you to be familiar with the equipment in your working space,
                    even if you don’t use it yourself. It’s also crucial to be cautious of what other researchers,
                    coworkers and peers are doing/using around you. By becoming familiar with the laboratory you’re
                    working in and always following proper safety procedures, you can help to prevent or eliminate
                    hazards. You will also know the proper steps to take in the unfortunate event that something does go
                    wrong. Labs are designed to with safety in mind, however, accidents can happen, which is why it’s
                    best to be prepared for the worst.</p>
                <p><i>Electricity</i><br>
                    In any lab, there are lots of electrical cords running throughout the room, keeping all of the
                    electronics running efficiently. Although electricity is needed to run throughout the entirety of
                    your laboratory, cords can become a safety hazard if not handled with care. Fire can breakout,
                    individuals can trip and fall over cords, or electrical equipment can get destroyed as a result of a

                <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
                <p> Binary number and digital codes are fundamental to computers and digital electronics. Computers
                    store information as “bits”, short for binary digit. A bit is a 0 or a 1, but can be represented in
                    many ways. For example, as true or false, or a light being on or off. In a computer, a 1 bit is
                    stored as an electrical voltage of 5V, and a 0 bit is 0 volts. This representation of 1’s and 0’s
                    are known as binary coding. The natural system for computers is to use base 2, which is the binary
                    number of system. Binary numbers use only the digits 0 and 1, and each position corresponds to a
                    power of 2.
                </p>
                <p>The decimal system is important because it is universally used to represent quantities outside a
                    digital system. In a decimal system, numbers are encoded in a positional number system. Each number
                    is represented by a string of digits, where each digit position has an associated weight. For
                    example: 3956 = (3*1000) + (9*100) + (5*10) + (4*1).</p>
                <p>Since binary code are extremely long, one way to simplify a binary code is by grouping into a group
                    of 4-bits or 3-bits. A group of 4-bit (nibbles) is called the hexadecimal number of system. It is a
                    base 16 system because it has 16 digits, 24 = 16. To represent a single hexadecimal digit, we use
                    0-9 and then A, B, C, D, E, F to represent the 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15, respectively.</p>
                <p>Like the hexadecimal number system, the octal number system provides a convenient way to express
                    binary number and codes. However, it is used less frequently than hexadecimal in conjunction with
                    computers and microprocessors to express binary quantities. One octal digit is a decimal
                    representation of a group of 3-bit. Therefore, the octal number system is a base of 8 system
                    composed of eight digits, 0-7.</p>

                <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
                <p>Digital signals is made up of series of 1’s and 0’s that represent numbers,
                    letters, symbols, or control signals. Those series of 1’s and 0’s can be measured using an
                    oscilloscope and plot into a timing diagram. In the timing diagram, logic of 1’s and 0’s is
                    represented by a HIGH and a LOW voltage level respectively. The voltage level to represent a HIGH is
                    between 1.5 V and 5 V, and a LOW voltage level is closed to 0 V. Timing diagram is used to show the
                    voltage level between 5 V and 0 V, which is digital logic 1 (HIGH = 5 V) and 0 (LOW = 0 V). </p>
                <p>
                    Logic gates are integrated circuit (IC) that performs a logic operation on one or more logic inputs,
                    and produce a single logic output. They are commonly found in digital circuit, and the five basic
                    logic gates are AND, OR, NAND, NOR, and NOT (inverter) gate, plus two especial gates which are
                    Exclusive-OR (X-OR) and Exclusive-NOR (X-NOR). For today’s lab, you will build and experiment seven
                    different logic gates. For each logic gate, build the circuit, observe and record the output in its
                    respective truth table, and sketch a timing diagram of the output signal according to the truth

                <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
                <p>The theoretical operation of a combination logic circuit can be predicted by
                    analyzing the circuit’s output for every possible input combination. The circuit analysis for each
                    input combination is performed by determining the resultant output of each gate, working from the
                    input side of the circuit to the output.</p>
                <p> Logic circuits may be functionally equivalent. They may perform the same function (their logic truth
                    tables are identical) but be constructed from different logic gates or interconnected in an entirely
                    different manner.</p>
                <p>The process of combinational circuit design start from obtaining a Sum-Of-Product, SOP, equation,
                    which is the most commonly used format for writing logic expressions. SOP expressions can be quickly
                    written from a truth table and they are easily implemented using a tow-level (not counting inverters
                    that may be needed) gate network. Conversely, these standard circuits that are used to implement SOP
                    functions can be quickly analyzed just by inspection. A SOP expression consists of two or more
                    products (AND operation) terms that are sum (OR operation) together. The SOP expression is obtained
                    from a truth table by writing down all of the product terms (called midterms) whose outputs are high
                    fro the desired function and then add them together. The resultant and simplified SOP expression can
                    be directly implemented with either AND/OR or NAND/NOR circuit designs. (Moss, 2004).</p>

                <p>Many times in the design on logic circuits, the logic output in SOP expression might have to reduce

                <p> Boolean algebra is used to describe how signals are combined to create a desired output. It is also
                    a very important tool, along with the application of DeMorgan’s theorem, uses to reduce expressions

            <div class="modContent">
                <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
                <p>The basic procedure for combinational logic circuit design is to first develop the truth table that
                    defines the desired function and then from the table, write a simplified SOP expression. The
                    expression can be simplified using various techniques such as Boolean algebra and Karnaugh Mapping.
                </p>
                <p> Karnaugh Mapping is a simple and fast procedure for reducing SOP logic expressions and thereby also
                    reducing the implemented circuit’s complexity and cost. In Karnaugh mapping, the function is defined
                    graphically. The relationship between the function’s inputs and the output are plotted in a Karnaugh
                    Map (K-Map). This will be the same information that would be listed in the truth table for the
                    function. If the K-Map is not properly labeled, the function cannot be correctly simplified and the
                    resulting design will be wrong. With K-Mapping, the function reduction is accomplished by forming
                    appropriate groupings of adjacent 1s in the output. In connection to it, the number of one that each
                    group can have must be in a base of 2, for example, group of 24 = 16, 23 = 8, 22 = 4 1s, 21 = 1, or
                    20 = 1 1’s. Then identify the common input variables for the group and write the indicated product
                    term.</p>
                <p>The Boolean rules are based on the expressions using inverters (NOT), AND, and OR gates, while
                    DeMorgan’s theorem are based on the equivalency of a NAND and NOR gates.</p>
                <p>Karnaugh Mapping can best be applied to functions with 5 or fewer input variables.</p>

                <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
                <p>A Binary Coded Decimal is a number in which each decimal digit is coded as a binary number. Each
                    decimal digit can be one of the following: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. The largest decimal
                    symbol is 9, and its binary representation needs 4 bits (10012).</p>
                <p> Therefore the input to a decoder that accepts a BCD number needs 4 input variables. In this
                    experiment we will assign the letters A (LSB), B, C, and D (MSB) to the BCD input variables.</p>
                <p>The Boolean rules are based on the expressions using inverters (NOT), AND, and OR gates, while
                    DeMorgan’s theorem are based on the equivalency of a NAND and NOR gates.</p>
                <p>A very popular and user friendly display for decimal symbols is the 7 segment display. This display
                    consists of 7 rectangular shaped LEDs arranged in a figure 8.1. Each one of these is named a through
                    g as can be seen in the following picture. There are two types of 7 segment displays, namely the
                    common anode and the common cathode. Here we will use a common anode display. Pin 3 is connected to
                    +5V. A 220 Ω resistor is connected to the cathode of each LED. To light any particular LED segment,
                    its resistor must be grounded. Therefore a ground (or 0) turns the LED on. Keep in mind that pins 4,
                    5, and 12 are not present in the display.</p>

                <p><b>Description</b></p>
                <p>Your first writing assignment is to read and write a critique of an article about numerical system.
                    The article is named Five Great 2014 Articles of Numerical System and it is published in
                    www.glossographia.wordpress.com (Glossgraphia, 2018). The argument of the critique must be linked to
                    the discussion of the subject as requested by the instructor. With respect to the technical part,
                    the format of the writing assignment has to follow the technical requirement established by the
                    instructor of the class. </p>
                <p><b>The article</b></p>
                <p>Bender, Andrea, and Sieghard Beller. 2014. “Mangarevan invention of binary steps for easier
                    calculation.” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 111 (4):1322-1327.</p>
                <p>When Leibniz demonstrated the advantages of the binary system for computations as early as 1703, he
                    laid the foundation for computing machines. However, is a binary system also suitable for human
                    cognition? One of two number systems traditionally used on Mangareva, a small island in French
                    Polynesia, had three binary steps superposed onto a decimal structure. Here, we show how this system
                    functions, how it facilitated arithmetic, and why it is unique. The Mangarevan invention of binary
                    steps, centuries before their formal description by Leibniz, attests to the advancements possible in
                    numeracy even in the absence of notation and thereby highlights the role of culture for the
                    evolution of and diversity in numerical cognition. (Glossgraphia, 2018)</p>
                <p><b>Discusssing the subject</b></p>
                <p>Technology and culture are key contributors to the way in which change occurs over time.<br>
                    According to the article, and your lived experience, do you believe there are benefits to using a
                    binary number system over a base of ten? What role does culture play in our number systems and how
                    has technological advancements modified our numeracy system over time.</p>

                <p><b>Description</b></p>
                <p>Your second writing assignment, you have to present your personal perspective to a social
                    technological issue assigned by your instructor. As part of this social technology writing
                    assignment, you have to visit a part of the community to collect information about the technology
                    issue and create supporting ideas to defend your perspective. You can also get information from the
                    internet or library citations as data and statistics to help in your discussion. All the information
                    obtained by the media mentioned must be documented as citations in your writing assignment.</p>
                <p>You are not required to do an extensive work on your project, but still you need to have good
                    supports on your arguments, good organization, and noteworthy ideas. Your purpose of your issue is
                    to determine how well you can develop a compelling argument supporting your own perspective on a
                    technological issue and propose solutions to it as an engineering technology student</p>
                <p><b>The technological issue</b></p>
                <p><i>With the blossoming of the internet, traditional libraries are obsolete. Students should not be
                        forced to learn traditional research skills, and public libraries should be demolished and the
                        lands they stand on used for more efficient public purposes.</i> </p>
                <p><b>Preparing your perspective</b></p>
                <p>You will not be expected to know specific critical thinking or writing terms or strategies;
                    instead,you should be able to use reasons, evidence, and examples to support your position on an
                    issue. Suppose, for instance, that an issue topic asks you consider whether it is important for
                    government to provide financial support public libraries. If your position is that government should
                    fund public libraries, you might support your position by discussing the reasons public libraries is
                    important and explain that libraries are public places where resources is available to anyone. On
                    the other hand, if your position is that government should not support public libraries, you might
                    point out that, given limited governmental funds, public libraries are not as deserving of
                    governmental funding as are other, more socially important, institutions.</p>
                <p>Or, if you are in favor of government funding for public libraries only under certain conditions, you
                    might focus on the technology criteria, cultural concerns, or economic conditions that you think
                    should determine how – or whether – public libraries receive government funds. It is not your
                    position that matters so much as the critical thinking skills you display in developing your
                    position.</p>
                <p>An excellent way to prepare for the issue task is to practice writing on some of the published
                    topics, but remember: you are not allow to copy and paste information from the internet or from a
                    document written by another person. There is no “best” approach: some people prefer to start
                    practicing without regard to the 45-minute time limit; others prefer to take a “timed test” first
                    and practice within the time limit. No matter which approach you take when you practice the issue
                    task, you should review the task directions, then:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Carefully read the claim made in the topic and make sure you understand the issue involved; if
                        it seems unclear, discuss it with a friend, relative, or instructor.</li>
                    <li>Think about the issue in relation to your own ideas and experiences, to events you have read
                        about or observed, and to people you have known; this is the knowledge base from which you will
                        develop compelling reasons and examples in your argument that reinforce, negate, or qualify the
                        claim in some way.</li>
                    <li>Decide what position on the issue you want to take and defend –remember you are free to agree or
                        disagree completely or to agree with some parts or some applications but not others.</li>
                    <li>Decide what compelling evidence (reasons and examples) you can use to support your position.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Once you have decided on a position to defend, consider the perspective of others who might not agree
                    with your position. Ask yourself:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What reasons might someone use to refute or undermine my position?</li>
                    <li>How should I acknowledge or defend against those views in my essay?</li>
                </ul>
                <p> To plan your response, you might want to summarize your position and make brief notes about how you
                    will support the position you are going to take. When you have done this, look over your notes and
                    decide how you will organize your response. Then write a response developing your position on the
                    issue. Even if you don’t write a full response, you should find it helpful to practice with a few of
                    the issue topics and to sketch out your possible responses.</p>
