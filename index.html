          This OER material is intended for use as the first level of Digital Computer Theory for a two and four year engineering technology program. The lecture and laboratory manual contains 13 weekly lecture and lab experiments.   The topics range from basic technical skills through numerical system, logic gates, combination of logic circuits, simplification of logic circuit using Boolean algebra, DeMorgan’s theory, and Karnaug Map, data control circuits such as multiplexer, binary adder, and BCD decoder, counter design, clock circuits using 555 timer.
          <br><br>
          Lab experiments include brief introduction of the experimental topics, step by step procedures, tables and graphs to record measurements, and questions to reinforce the understanding of the theory with the experimental results. Each lab experiment is designed to be completed using a two to three hour practicum period. For equipment, each lab station should include a dual adjustable DC power supply and a quality DMM capable of reading DC voltage, current and resistance.

        <div class="content">
          <p><b>Introduction</b><br><br>The impact of the digital computer on society has been tremendous; in its various forms, it is used to run everything from spacecraft to factories, health-care systems to telecommunications, banks to household budgets.
            <br><br>
          The story of how the digital computer evolved is largely the story of an unending search for labor-saving devices. Its roots go back beyond the calculating machines of the 1600s to the pebbles (in Latin, calculi ) that the merchants of Rome used for counting and to the abacus of the fifth century b.c. Although none of these early devices were automatic, they were useful in a world where mathematical calculations performed by human beings were full of human error.
          <br><br>
          Digital computer operates on discrete quantities (compare analog computer). All computation is done within a finite number system and with limited precision, associated with the number of digits in the discrete numbers. The numerical information is most often represented by the use of two-state electrical phenomena (on/off, high voltage/low voltage, current/no current, etc.) to indicate whether the value of a binary variable is a “zero” or a “one”. Usually there is automatic control or sequencing (through a program) of operations so that they can be carried through to completion without intervention.

        <div class="content">
            <p><b>Introduction</b><br><br>Numerical system is a representative way to display digits, symbols, or letters. There are different ways to represent them, for example, binary number is the fundamental system use in computers and digital electronics because computers store information as 0 and 1, or “bits”, which is a short word for binary digit. On the other hand, outside the computer world, the universal number of system used to represent quantities is the decimal system. Decimal system is the number system used in every day to represent quantities from the beginning of many ancient cultures where they calculated with numerals based on ten, as the human hands have 10 digits.
            <br><br>
            In this chapter, students will learn the different number of system use between the world of computers and humans, and how to make the conversion between systems in order for the two different world to understand and communicate. The number of system that will be covered are decimal, binary, hexadecimal, and octal system. At the end of this chapter, BCD, and ASCII number of system.

        <button class="collapsible">Chapter 4. Combination of logic circuit</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p><b>Introduction</b><br><br>
            In digital circuit theory, combinational logic (sometimes also referred to as time-independent logic ) is a type of digital logic which is implemented by Boolean circuits, where the output is a pure function of the present input only.
            Combinational logic is used in computer circuits to perform Boolean algebra on input signals and on stored data. Practical computer circuits normally contain a mixture of combinational and sequential logic. For example, the part of an arithmetic logic unit, or ALU, that does mathematical calculations is constructed using combinational logic. Other circuits used in computers, such as half adders, full adders, half subtractors, full subtractors, multiplexers, demultiplexers, encoders and decoders are also made by using combinational logic. (Wikipedia, 2019).

            <p><b>Introduction</b><br><br>
            Boolean algebra is the mathematics of digital systems. It is used to help analyze a logic circuit and express its operation mathematically. Therefore, Boolean algebra can be used to simplify or to find an equivalent logic circuit.  The main operations of Boolean algebra are the conjunction and denoted as ∧, Boolean addition, the disjunction or denoted as ∨, Boolean multiplication, and the negation not denoted as ¬.

        <div class="content">
            <p><b>Introduction</b><br><br>
		The outputs of Combinational Logic Circuits are only determined by the logical function of their current input state, logic “0” or logic “1”, at any given instant in time.
	   	<br><br>The result is that combinational logic circuits have no feedback, and any changes to the signals being applied to their inputs will immediately have an effect at the output. In other words, in a Combinational Logic Circuit, the output is dependent at all times on the combination of its inputs. Thus a combinational circuit is memoryless.

        <br><br>
        <p><b>Introduction</b><br><br>
          Laboratories reap a wide array of safety hazards, which is why it is so vital to understand the important of lab safety. If something goes awry, more than just your research project schedule can be affected. Equipment can be damaged, fines can occur, and individuals on your team can be injured.
          <br><br>
          When working in a lab, it is important you to be familiar with the equipment in your working space, even if you don’t use it yourself. It’s also crucial to be cautious of what other researchers, coworkers and peers are doing/using around you. By becoming familiar with the laboratory you’re working in and always following proper safety procedures, you can help to prevent or eliminate hazards. You will also know the proper steps to take in the unfortunate event that something does go wrong. Labs are designed to with safety in mind, however, accidents can happen, which is why it’s best to be prepared for the worst.
          <br><br>
          <i>Electricity</i><br>
          In any lab, there are lots of electrical cords running throughout the room, keeping all of the electronics running efficiently. Although electricity is needed to run throughout the entirety of your laboratory, cords can become a safety hazard if not handled with care. Fire can breakout, individuals can trip and fall over cords, or electrical equipment can get destroyed as a result of a faulty electrical connection.
          <br><br>
          To prevent any of the aforementioned from happening, invest in power cords, outlets and power strips. Also, don’t leave cords near heat sources, avoid running cords on the ground near doorways, refrain from using extension cords and don’t connect power strips together.
          <br><br>
          Therefore, it is important that you watch the following <i>Lab Safety and Lab Behavior</i> video so you can complete the lab experiments safely and efficiently.

        <button class="collapsible colorLab">Lab Experiment 1: Number Systems and Codes</button>
        <div class="content">
          <p><b>Introduction</b><br><br>Binary number and digital codes are fundamental to computers and digital electronics. Computers store information as “bits”, short for binary digit. A bit is a 0 or a 1, but can be represented in many ways. For example, as true or false, or a light being on or off. In a computer, a 1 bit is stored as an electrical voltage of 5V, and a 0 bit is 0 volts.  This representation of 1’s and 0’s are known as binary coding. The natural system for computers is to use base 2, which is the binary number of system. Binary numbers use only the digits 0 and 1, and each position corresponds to a power of 2.
            <br><br>
          The decimal system is important because it is universally used to represent quantities outside a digital system. In a decimal system, numbers are encoded in a positional number system. Each number is represented by a string of digits, where each digit position has an associated weight. For example: 3956 = (3*1000) + (9*100) + (5*10) + (4*1).
            <br><br>
          Since binary code are extremely long, one way to simplify a binary code is by grouping into a group of 4-bits or 3-bits. A group of 4-bit (nibbles) is called the hexadecimal number of system. It is a base 16 system because it has 16 digits, 24 = 16. To represent a single hexadecimal digit, we use 0-9 and then A, B, C, D, E, F to represent the 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15, respectively.
          <br><br>
          Like the hexadecimal number system, the octal number system provides a convenient way to express binary number and codes. However, it is used less frequently than hexadecimal in conjunction with computers and microprocessors to express binary quantities. One octal digit is a decimal representation of a group of 3-bit. Therefore, the octal number system is a base of 8 system composed of eight digits, 0-7.

          <p><b>Introduction</b><br><br>Multisim is a schematic capture and simulation application that assists you in carrying out the major steps in the circuit design flow. Multisim can be used for both analog and digital circuits and also includes mixed analog/digital simulation capability, and microcontroller co-simulation. Simulating the circuits before building them, catches errors early in the design flow, saving time and money.

            <p><b>Introduction</b><br><br>Digital signals is made up of series of 1’s and 0’s that represent numbers, letters, symbols, or control signals. Those series of 1’s and 0’s can be measured using an oscilloscope and plot into a timing diagram. In the timing diagram, logic of 1’s and 0’s is represented by a HIGH and a LOW voltage level respectively. The voltage level to represent a HIGH is between 1.5 V and 5 V, and a LOW voltage level is closed to 0 V. Timing diagram is used to show the voltage level between 5 V and 0 V, which is digital logic 1 (HIGH = 5 V) and 0 (LOW = 0 V). <br><br>
            Logic gates are integrated circuit (IC) that performs a logic operation on one or more logic inputs, and produce a single logic output. They are commonly found in digital circuit, and the five basic logic gates are AND, OR, NAND, NOR, and NOT (inverter) gate, plus two especial gates which are Exclusive-OR (X-OR) and Exclusive-NOR (X-NOR). For today’s lab, you will build and experiment seven different logic gates.  For each logic gate, build the circuit, observe and record the output in its respective truth table, and sketch a timing diagram of the output signal according to the truth table.

        <div class="content">
            <p><b>Introduction</b><br><br>The theoretical operation of a combination logic circuit can be predicted by analyzing the circuit’s output for every possible input combination. The circuit analysis for each input combination is performed by determining the resultant output of each gate, working from the input side of the circuit to the output.
              <br><br>
            Logic circuits may be functionally equivalent. They may perform the same function (their logic truth tables are identical) but be constructed from different logic gates or interconnected in an entirely different manner.
            <br><br>
            The process of combinational circuit design start from obtaining a Sum-Of-Product, SOP, equation, which is the most commonly used format for writing logic expressions. SOP expressions can be quickly written from a truth table and they are easily implemented using a tow-level (not counting inverters that may be needed) gate network. Conversely, these standard circuits that are used to implement SOP functions can be quickly analyzed just by inspection. A SOP expression consists of two or more products (AND operation) terms that are sum (OR operation) together. The SOP expression is obtained from a truth table by writing down all of the product terms (called midterms) whose outputs are high fro the desired function and then add them together. The resultant and simplified SOP expression can be directly implemented with either AND/OR or NAND/NOR circuit designs. (Moss, 2004).

        <div class="content">
            <p><b>Introduction</b><br><br>Many times in the design on logic circuits, the logic output in SOP expression might have to reduce to its simplest form or change its form to a more convenient one to implement the expression most efficiently.
              <br><br>
              Boolean algebra is used to describe how signals are combined to create a desired output. It is also a very important tool, along with the application of DeMorgan’s theorem, uses to reduce expressions to minimal terms to minimize the hardware required in constructing a circuit.
              <br><br>
              The Boolean rules are based on the expressions using inverters (NOT), AND, and OR gates, while DeMorgan’s theorem are based on the equivalency of a NAND and NOR gates.

        <button class="collapsible colorLab">Lab Experiment 7: Simplification of Logic Circuit Using Karnaugh Map</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p><b>Introduction</b><br><br>The basic procedure for combinational logic circuit design is to first develop the truth table that defines the desired function and then from the table, write a simplified SOP expression. The expression can be simplified using various techniques such as Boolean algebra and Karnaugh Mapping.
            <br><br>
            Karnaugh Mapping is a simple and fast procedure for reducing SOP logic expressions and thereby also reducing the implemented circuit’s complexity and cost. In Karnaugh mapping, the function is defined graphically. The relationship between the function’s inputs and the output are plotted in a Karnaugh Map (K-Map). This will be the same information that would be listed in the truth table for the function. If the K-Map is not properly labeled, the function cannot be correctly simplified and the resulting design will be wrong. With K-Mapping, the function reduction is accomplished by forming appropriate groupings of adjacent 1s in the output. In connection to it, the number of one that each group can have must be in a base of 2, for example, group of 24 = 16, 23 = 8, 22 = 4 1s, 21 = 1, or 20 = 1 1’s. Then identify the common input variables for the group and write the indicated product term.
            <br><br>
            Karnaugh Mapping can best be applied to functions with 5 or fewer input variables.

        <div class="content">
            <p>Introduction</b><br><br>A Binary Coded Decimal is a number in which each decimal digit is coded as a binary number. Each decimal digit can be one of the following: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. The largest decimal symbol is 9, and its binary representation needs 4 bits (10012.).
              <br><br>
            Therefore the input to a decoder that accepts a BCD number needs 4 input variables. In this experiment we will assign the letters A (LSB), B, C, and D (MSB) to the BCD input variables.
            <br><br>
            A very popular and user friendly display for decimal symbols is the 7 segment display. This display consists of 7 rectangular shaped LEDs arranged in a figure 8.1. Each one of these is named a through g as can be seen in the following picture. There are two types of 7 segment displays, namely the common anode and the common cathode. Here we will use a common anode display. Pin 3 is connected to +5V. A 220 Ω resistor is connected to the cathode of each LED. To light any particular LED segment, its resistor must be grounded. Therefore a ground (or 0) turns the LED on. Keep in mind that pins 4, 5, and 12 are not present in the display.

            <br>
            When Leibniz demonstrated the advantages of the binary system for computations as early as 1703, he laid the foundation for computing machines. However, is a binary system also suitable for human cognition? One of two number systems traditionally used on Mangareva, a small island in French Polynesia, had three binary steps superposed onto a decimal structure. Here, we show how this system functions, how it facilitated arithmetic, and why it is unique. The Mangarevan invention of binary steps, centuries before their formal description by Leibniz, attests to the advancements possible in numeracy even in the absence of notation and thereby highlights the role of culture for the evolution of and diversity in numerical cognition.

              <dt><b>GENERAL DESCRIPTION</b></dt><br>
              <dd>Your second writing assignment, you have to present your personal perspective to a social technological issue assigned by your instructor. As part of this social technology writing assignment, you have to visit a part of the community to collect information about the technology issue and create supporting ideas to defend your perspective. You can also get information from the internet or library citations as data and statistics to help in your discussion. All the information obtained by the media mentioned must be documented as citations in your writing assignment.
              <br><br>
              You are not required to do an extensive work on your project, but still you need to have good supports on your arguments, good organization, and noteworthy ideas. Your purpose of your issue is to determine how well you can develop a compelling argument supporting your own perspective on a technological issue and propose solutions to it as an engineering technology student</dd>
              <br><br>
              <dt><b>THE TECHNOLOGICAL ISSUE</b></dt><br>
              <dd> <i>With the blossoming of the internet, traditional libraries are obsolete. Students should not be forced to learn traditional research skills, and public libraries should be demolished and the lands they stand on used for more efficient public purposes.</i> </dd>
              <br><br>
              <dt> <b>PREPARING YOUR PERSPECTIVE</b> </dt> <br>
              <dd>You will not be expected to know specific critical thinking or writing terms or strategies; instead, you should be able to use reasons, evidence, and examples to support your position on an issue. Suppose, for instance, that an issue topic asks you consider whether it is important for government to provide financial support public libraries. If your position is that government should fund public libraries, you might support your position by discussing the reasons public libraries is important and explain that libraries are public places where resources is available to anyone. On the other hand, if your position is that government should not support public libraries, you might point out that, given limited governmental funds, public libraries are not as deserving of governmental funding as are other, more socially important, institutions.
              <br><br>
               Or, if you are in favor of government funding for public libraries only under certain conditions, you might focus on the technology criteria, cultural concerns, or economic conditions that you think should determine how – or whether – public libraries receive government funds. It is not your position that matters so much as the critical thinking skills you display in developing your position.
              <br><br>
              An excellent way to prepare for the issue task is to practice writing on some of the published topics, but remember: you are not allow to copy and paste information from the internet or from a document written by another person. There is no “best” approach: some people prefer to start practicing without regard to the 45-minute time limit; others prefer to take a “timed test” first and practice within the time limit. No matter which approach you take when you practice the issue task, you should review the task directions, then:
              <ul>
                <li>Carefully read the claim made in the topic and make sure you understand the issue involved; if it seems unclear, discuss it with a friend, relative, or instructor.</li>
                <li>Think about the issue in relation to your own ideas and experiences, to events you have read about or observed, and to people you have known; this is the knowledge base from which you will develop compelling reasons and examples in your argument that reinforce, negate, or qualify the claim in some way.</li>
                <li>Decide what position on the issue you want to take and defend –remember you are free to agree or disagree completely or to agree with some parts or some applications but not others.</li>
                <li>Decide what compelling evidence (reasons and examples) you can use to support your position.</li>
              </ul>
              Once you have decided on a position to defend, consider the perspective of others who might not agree with your position. Ask yourself:
              <ul>
                <li>What reasons might someone use to refute or undermine my position?</li>
                <li>How should I acknowledge or defend against those views in my essay?</li>
              </ul>
              To plan your response, you might want to summarize your position and make brief notes about how you will support the position you are going to take. When you have done this, look over your notes and decide how you will organize your response. Then write a response developing your position on the issue. Even if you don’t write a full response, you should find it helpful to practice with a few of the issue topics and to sketch out your possible responses.
